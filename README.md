# Comparative-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Telegram-Channels-During-the-Ukraine-Russia-War
Thesis project
The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, characterized by deepseated historical and 
geopolitical tensions, has escalated in intensity in recent years, resulting in increased military 
operations and significant global implications. Despite ongoing efforts to resolve the conflict, 
the war remains an active and contentious issue, with both sides engaging in intense 
information warfare on digital media. This study aims to investigate the public's perception 
and portrayal of the war through sentiment analysis of Telegram channels, a wellknown social 
media platform in both Russia and Ukraine.  
In particular, the study analyzed posts from four Telegram channels, two of which were 
Ukrainian and the other two Russian, made in January 2024 and August 2024. The study 
examines the opinions expressed on these platforms to gain insight into the psychological and 
emotional landscape of the conflict as it is portrayed on social media.  
The research utilized sentiment analysis techniques to determine the frequency of positive, 
neutral, and negative attitudes in the communications. The results revealed a significant 
amount of negative emotion across all channels, reflecting the devastating reality of war. 
However, notable differences were observed between the Russian and Ukrainian channels, 
with Ukrainian channels displaying a higher concentration of negative emotion, likely due to 
the direct impact of the conflict on the general population. 
This study provides valuable perspectives on the role of digital communication in 
contemporary warfare and contributes to our understanding of how social media platforms 
like Telegram are utilized to shape and reflect public opinion during times of conflict.
