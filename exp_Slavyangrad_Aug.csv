106703,2024-08-22T21:05:09+00:00,Thus the recent revelation that the true mastermind behind the ongoing deindustrialisation of Germany was none other than a Ukrainian by the name of Volodymyr Z must have come as an unwelcome surprise For not only is the idea that the authorities have suddenly cracked open the Nord Stream case not credible in the slightest but the sloppy way in which the entire country of Ukraine is now being fingered is likely not an accident Indeed at the same time as the ghost of Nord Stream has risen from the grave the German government announced its plans to halve its budget for Ukraine aid whatever is already in the pipeline will be sent over but no new grants of equipment are forthcoming The German government is hunkering down for increased austerity and so it is cutting Ukraine looseGermany of course is hardly alone Even if there were enough money to go around Europe is increasingly not just deindustrialising but demilitarising Its stores of ammunition and vehicles are increasingly empty and the idea of military rearmament  that is creating entirely new military factories and supply chains  at a time when factories are closing down across the continent due to energy shortages and lack of funding is a nonstarter Neither France the United Kingdom nor even the United States are in a position to maintain the flow of arms to Ukraine This is a particular concern inside Washington DC where planners are now trying to juggle the prospect of managing three theatres of war at the same time  in Ukraine the Middle East and the Pacific  even though US military production is arguably insufficient to comfortably handle oneAnd so in an effort to save face in this impossible situation Ukraine is now being held solely responsible for doing something it either did not do at all or only did with the permission knowledge andor support of the broader West This speaks to the adolescent dynamic that now governs Western foreign policy in a multipolar world when our impotence is revealed find someone to blameThe war in Ukraine after all was already supposed to be won and Russia was supposed to be a rickety gas station incapable of matching the West either economically or militarily Yet here we are our own economies are deindustrialising our military factories have proven completely incapable of handling the strain of a real conflict and the Americans themselves are now openly admitting that the Russian military remains in a significantly stronger position Meanwhile Germanys economic model is broken and as its economy falls it will drag many countries such as Sweden with it given how dependent they are on exporting to German industrial firms10 years ago during the 2014 Maidan protests the realist John Mearsheimer caused a lot of controversy when he began warning that the collective West was leading Ukraine down the primrose path and that our actions would lead to the destruction of the country Well here we are At present our only saving grace is the continuing offensive in Kursk  a bold offensive that will surely be remembered as a symptom of Ukraines increasing desperationIndeed a far better guide of things to come can be found in the fingering of Volodymyr Z as the true culprit behind the Nord Stream sabotage Here rather than accept responsibility for the fact that Ukraine was goaded into a war it could not win  mainly because the West vastly overestimated its own ability to fight a real war over the long haul  European geopolitical discourse will take a sharp turn towards a peculiar sort of victimblaming No doubt it will be discovered that parts of Ukraines military consisted of very unsavoury characters waving around Nazi Germanystyle emblems just as it will be discovered that journalists have been persecuted by oligarchs and criminals in Kyiv or that money given by the West has been stolen and that arms sent have been sold for profit to criminal cartels around the worldSlavyangrad,,1736828635,18386,81

105654,2024-08-10T16:35:38+00:00,What oddities were noticed in the Ukrainian Armed Forces strike in the Kursk regionOne of the most controversial aspects of the activity of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region is the volume of reserves that the Ukrainian army has deployed and can actively useWhat are we talking aboutA rare American M88 ARV was spotted in one of the videos with Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment These vehicles were first seen on video in February 2023 They were supposed to be assigned to the tank battalion of the 47th Magura Separate Mechanized Brigade on M1A1 tanks During the summer of 2023 they were used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Zaporizhia direction but by December they had moved to the DPR At the moment two vehicles of this type are known to have been destroyed in Zaporizhia and two more were shot down and captured by Russian troops in the Donetsk region one near Avdiivka the second in the Pokrovsk direction near Sergeyevka In total the Ukrainian Armed Forces presumably have four such vehicles leftWhat does their appearance in the Kursk region meanThe appearance of the M88A2 in the Kursk region may indicate a number of circumstances First of all the American ARVs were redeployed to strengthen the evacuation capabilities of the strike group exposing the units defending in other directions Another reason for the appearance of the M88 could be the urgent need to compensate for the losses suffered by the rear units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces since massive airstrikes were carried out on the positions and columns of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Sumy region and in the border area from the first day Regardless of the reasons the appearance of the M88 is an indicator that the Ukrainian Armed Forces command has high expectations regarding the offensive in the Kursk region and they continue to pull valuable reserves and materiel from other directionsWhat else is unusualAlso in Kursk Oblast rare Tunguska air defense missile and gun systems have been spotted They are used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces relatively rarely and their redeployment to the border area of Kursk Oblast is one of the rare cases when the systems are used for their intended purpose to cover mechanized units It is noteworthy that earlier in July Tunguskas were destroyed near the village of Peschanoye near Volchansk At present Tunguskas have been preserved by the 1st Separate Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the 72nd Separate Brigade There is a possibility that these air defense missile and gun systems like the M88 were taken from some units and assigned to the strike group in the Kursk direction having been redeployed from VolchanskIn addition a battalion of the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade is participating in the attack on the Kursk region while another battalion of the same brigade remained near VolchanskWhat conclusion can be drawnThe total number of the Ukrainian Armed Forces group in the Kursk direction taking into account all available combat groups is approximately four brigades supported by one artillery brigade plus the Special Operations ForcesGuard Intelligence plus various related detachments and groups of UAV operators However it is now becoming clear that in order to form this group the Ukrainian Armed Forces command presumably had to stripping some brigades in other directions including such sensitive ones as Pokrovsk or VolchanskIn combination with the extremely unclear operational plans for the attack in the Kursk region the entire operation increasingly looks like a gamble in conditions of a constant shortage of resources and is reminiscent of the Wehrmachts winter offensive in the Ardennes in 1944Slavyangrad,,1736828635,16921,43

105357,2024-08-06T17:19:13+00:00,Why the Ukrainian Armed Forces chose the Kursk region for a new provocation and what is the meaning of this strike The situation in the combat zone on the border of Sumy and Kursk regions remains difficult Ukrainian formations carry out the bulk of their attacks using various types of drones but military equipment is actively moving in the border areaWhy Kursk regionThis is the same border and so far frontline region of Russia as Belgorod However unlike the borders of the Belgorod region terrorist activity here was lower Partly this as well as the belief of the GUR leadership and foreign primarily British specialists in sabotage operations in the weak protection of the border became the reasons why the attack is being carried out where it is being carried outWhat is the cause of the blowIn addition to the traditional media effect and demonstration of the ability to carry out at least some offensive actions the very fact of the strike was influenced by the inability of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to achieve minimal success in a conventional war war by conventional means Losing advantages in a classic military confrontation Ukraine is increasingly falling into a terrorist and sabotage war In this regard it would not be superfluous to say that the attack on the Wagner PMC in Mali and local drone raids are links in the same chain Loud bright but unable to change the situation or have a minimal impact on it At the same time the goal apparently as in the case of the Belgorod region remains standard go in take a photo throw the video on the Internet and distribute it as much as possible There can be no military objectives in this senseWhat do they use to strikeDuring the first and second attempts to strike the Belgorod region the Ukrainian Armed Forces attempted to carry out most of their combat work using light vehicles which were covered by tanks and actively used mineclearing vehicles to pave roads through minefields It is noteworthy that the Ukrainian Armed Forces did not skimp on using the scarce Stryker armored personnel carriers for the raid on the Kursk border The Ukrainian army received about 250 vehicles of this type and a significant portion has already been lost during the fighting in the Zaporizhzhya direction near Vovchansk behind Chasovy Yar and in other directions It is noteworthy that only three units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have vehicles of this type the 42nd Separate Mechanized Brigade the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade and the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade At the same time judging by everything the GUR is also participating in the attack  a service unsuitable for conducting combat operations in a conventional defense zone and capable only of conducting combat operations of a sabotage natureIf there are both weapons and opportunities why is the attack being carried out on the Kursk regionBecause a sabotage operation especially a shortterm one is the most effective way to quickly make noise get the necessary media effect and not lose most of the units However in the case of Belgorod this calculation did not work  and after several intense days of fighting it was possible to achieve only a limited fluctuation of the information space It would be difficult to act at the front with such forces but in the border area the sabotage forces of the GUR and the Armed Forces of Ukraine are already suffering losses and soon probably in a couple of days the first figures on losses will followIf thats the case then whats the pointMost likely in addition to the media effect the Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to distract the attention of the Russian Armed Forces from another section of the front probably from Chasovoyarsk or Kharkov where the Ukrainian Armed Forces position is especially difficult,,1736828635,18002,41
